./configure --enable-gpl --enable-libx264 --enable-libx265 --enable-nonfree
nasm/yasm not found or too old. Use --disable-x86asm for a crippled build.

If you think configure made a mistake, make sure you are using the latest
version from Git.  If the latest version fails, report the problem to the
ffmpeg-user@ffmpeg.org mailing list or IRC #ffmpeg on irc.freenode.net.
Include the log file "ffbuild/config.log" produced by configure as this will help
solve the problem.
